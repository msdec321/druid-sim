# Druid Simulator

A World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade Restoration Druid healing simulator. Practice your healing rotation, experiment with different gear sets, and master raid encounters in an interactive browser-based environment that faithfully recreates TBC healing mechanics including HoTs, spell coefficients, mana management, and the five-second rule.

**Live App:** [https://druid-sim.com/](https://druid-sim.com/)

## Encounters

Face off against configurable raid encounters with realistic damage patterns. The simulator features tank damage, raid-wide AoE, and random target mechanics. NPC healers (Resto Shamans) provide AI-controlled support with proper Chain Heal mechanics. Track your healing output, overheal percentage, and mana efficiency as you work to keep the raid alive.

## Gearsets

Choose from five progression tiers of pre-configured gear sets spanning the entire TBC content cycle:

- **Pre-Raid BiS** - Heroic dungeons and crafted gear
- **Tier 4** - Karazhan, Gruul's Lair, and Magtheridon
- **Tier 5** - Serpentshrine Cavern and Tempest Keep
- **Tier 6** - Black Temple and Mount Hyjal
- **Sunwell Plateau** - Best-in-slot gear

Each gear set includes accurate stats for spell power, intellect, spirit, MP5, haste, and crit rating.

## Action Bars, Keybinds, and Macros

Customize your healing setup with a flexible action bar system:

- **5 Action Bars** - 60 total slots for spells and macros
- **Keybindings** - Bind any key to action bar slots
- **Macro Support** - Create macros with `/cast` commands and target modifiers

All configurations are saved to your browser's local storage and persist between sessions.

## Raid Composition

Configure your 25-man raid with any combination of TBC classes and specializations. Each class has accurate health pools based on role (tanks, healers, DPS). The raid composition affects how damage is distributed and how NPC healers prioritize their targets.
